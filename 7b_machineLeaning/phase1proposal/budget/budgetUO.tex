%%   Notes regarding Budget:
  
%%   \begin{itemize}
%%     \item Although there is no absolute cap on indirect costs, grant
%%       applications will be evaluated for overall economy and value to
%%       DOE.

%%     \item Tuition expenses are only allowable if requested from a
%%       subcontractor that is a University and if the amount requested
%%       for tuition is reasonable and comparable to the amount a student
%%       would be paid for performing research during the grant period.

%%     \item Travel funds must be justified and directly related to the
%%       needs of the project.  Travel expenses for technical conferences
%%       are not permitted unless the purpose of attending the conference
%%       directly relates to the project (e.g., to present research
%%       results of the project).  Funds to cover travel expenses outside
%%       of the U.S. is considered an unallowable cost unless written
%%       approval has been obtained from the SBIR/STTR Program Manager.

%%      \item Grants may include a profit or fee for the small business.

%%      \item Any commercial and/or in-kind contribution to the project
%%        should be reflected in the project narrative and not included
%%        on the budget pages.
