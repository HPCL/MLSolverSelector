\section{Anticipated Public Benefits}
%% {\em Discuss the technical, economic, social, and other benefits to the
%%  public as a whole anticipated if the project is successful and is
%%  carried over into Phases II and III.  Identify specific groups in the
%%  commercial sector as well as the Federal Government that would
%%  benefit from the projected results.  Describe the resultant product
%%  or process, the likelihood that it could lead to a marketable
%%  product, and the significance of the market.}

The proposed project will facilitate runtime performance tuning of numerical simulations based on 
both the computational model and the compuation architecture, in terms of any combination of measurable metrics ( 
e.g., CPU time, Memory consumption, energy efficiency). Numerical simulations, widely applicable across various scientific 
disciplines, play a large role in . All of these numerical algorithms and simulations could benefit
from machine learning based performance tuning. M



The results of this project will form an empirical basis and provide a 
platform for choosing the right numerical method at runtime based on the problem 
characteristics and the compute architecture. The computational scientists, numerical software developers, and 
electrical engineers will be able to let the software decide the best performing 
method without the need for labor-intensive experimentation, and thus focus on more 
scientific aspects of their applications.

The targeted customers include nuclear power companies, DoD and its Prime Contractors, 
NASA divisions, DOE agencies, CFD software providers, oil and gas companies, semiconductor 
design companies etc.
