\section{Technical Objectives}
%% {\em State the specific technical objectives of the Phase I effort,
%%   including the questions it will try to answer to determine the
%%   feasibility of the proposed approach.}
 
To demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed approach, the Phase I effort will focus on developing a functional proof of concept for the SASI framework. The specific objectives RNET Technologies, and its subcontractor (UO) will pursue during the Phase I project are:
\todo{ I have a tendency to promise the world in these applications -- Do you think this is to much for a phase I, or not enough.. or } 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Develop the core interfaces and software indirections required to create a framework that 
  guides the user through the process of building and using an accurate and reliable SASI model.
  \item Prototype a range of tools for ensuring the SASI models are valid, including automated testing and analysis of the features, training data and model. 
  \item Investigate of approaches for reusing, modifying and/or re-purposing training data obtained on other architectures and/or from alternative algorithms or application areas in new models and for new architectures. 
  \item Demonstrate the effectiveness of the SASI framework by applying it to graph algorithms, a numerical subproblem that
  project team has experience developing SASI models for, but for which no sophisticated integration framework has been developed. 
\end{itemize}

By achieving these four objectives, RNET will demonstrate the scientific and commercial potential of the proposed package. The investigation into approaches for re-using data through Baysian transfer learning represents the key and novel scientific contribution of the proposed project. The core framework and that additional tools for validation and verifitcation of the model represent the technology that RNET will look to commercialize.
