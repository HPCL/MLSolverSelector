\section{Principal Investigator and other Key Personnel}
%{\em The Principal Investigator (PI) must be knowledgeable in all
%  technical aspects of the grant application and be capable of leading
%  the research effort and meet the requirements described in Part III,
%  C.  Describe the effort to be performed by the PI during the
%  project.}

\subsection{Dr. Gerald Sabin, Principal Investigator}
Dr. Gerald Sabin, senior researcher at RNET, will be the PI on this project and is a US Citizen.  Dr.  Sabin is a full time employee of RNET, and has
sufficient time to dedicate to project tasks as indicated in the cost
proposal. Currently, he is working on several Scientific Computing (HPC) 
SBIR/STTR projects at RNET. He is the PI the 
ongoing Phase II DARPA project developing a linear solver library for graph applications  and on the Phase II SBIR project 
(DE-SC0015748) developing a ``Web Infrastructure for Remote Modeling and
Simulation of Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycle Systems''. He is also the PI on the 
ongoing Phase II DOE project (DE-FOA-001490) for the Automated Solver Selection for Nuclear Engineering 
Simulations. He has also worked on distributed memory, GPU, multi-core and SIMD 
optimizations to the Air Force's Kestrel code (DOD Contract\#:FA9550-12-C-0028). He has also been the PI on several other
related projects including a NASA Phase I project developing SIMD
optimizations for Monte Carlo codes (NNX14CA44P), developing
parallelization optimizations for PETSc (DOE Contract\#:
DE-SC0002434), and developing data virtualization support and bitmap
indexing for massive Climate Modeling data sets (DOE Contract
\#:DE-SC0009520).

\subsection{Ben O'Neill}
Ben O'Neill is a Research Scientist at RNET. Ben is a full time employee at
RNET and has sufficient time to dedicate to this project. Dr. O'Neill is a Permanent Resident of the United States 
and a Citizen of New Zealand. Currently is currently the lead developer for He is also the PI on the 
ongoing Phase II DOE project (DE-FOA-001490) for the Automated Solver Selection for Nuclear Engineering 
Simulations.



PI for the Vera Workbench project that involves 
developing a GUI for the VERA suite of tools that supports graphical
visualization of VERA input files, remote launching of jobs on local or
cloud based clusters and visualization of the VERA output file. He is also 
involved in the ``Web Infrastructure for Remote Modeling
and Simulation of Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycle Systems'' project  which aims to
develop a web-enabled interface for remote execution and visualization for nuclear 
physics tools. His background is in Applied mathematics, high performance computing,
and parallel-time integration. His work includes a detailed investigation into parallel-time-integration
with MGRIT for nonlinear problems, an enhanced MGRIT algorithm based on Richardson extrapolation and he is also
involved in implementing several features currently under development in the XBraid project, 
including a temporal load balancing algorithm.
