# Machine Learning-Based PETSc Linear Solver Selection 

This work focuses on sampling-based and matrix-free linear solver selection; it is related to the [Lighthouse](http://lighthousehpc.github.io/lighthouse/)
project on linear solver taxononmy and ML-based modeling.

A prototype C++ KSP solver implementation is also included; note that it may not be up-to-date with the latest version of [PETSc](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc).
