#### THERE ARE SOME MAJOR LICVENCE ISSUES WITH C5.0 IN HERE. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE
#### CODE --- The C5.0 code is copied and pasted -- almost verbatim -- into 
#### the C50 core function. To release this, we probably will need to make 
### the " C50 c++ " interface openly available (which is a problem, cause it 
### a mess, and I have NO idea what it actualy does ) . 



This is the solverselector lite library. This library creates a petsc ksp
that can be used to select the best solver and runtime based on a prebuilt
C5.0 model. 

To install the library 

  1) Open Makefile.inc and set the PETSC_DIR, INSTALL_DIR and the compiler flags. 
  2) Type make
  3) Type make install 


To install a new feature set see the README in the feature_sets directory. 

For examples of Using the library, see the examples directory.
