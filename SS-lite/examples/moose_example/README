From what I can tell, most MOOSE applications are run "in source", so writing an example is not really all
that useful. 

Instead, this directory provides examples of the two files you will need to edit in a MOOSE application to 
get the ss-lite library working. 


The first step is to get the SS-Lite library linked into the MOOSE executable. To do this, add the following 
lines to your specific MOOSE applications Makefile. 

include <ss-lite-install-dir>/Makefile.inc 
ADDITIONAL_INCLUDES += $(SS_INCLUDE)
ADDITIONAL_LIBS += $(SS_LIBS) 

E.g., to use ss-lite in the Moose solid mechanics module, you would add this to the file at 
   .../moose/modules/solid_mechanics/Makefile 


The next step is to register the ss-lite solver with PETSc inside the application. Open up the 
file in <application>/src/main.C 

   a) Add the incldue file    " #include "PetscInterface.h" " at the top with the other includes. 
   b) Add the line " PetscCoupler::CreateSolverSelectorKSP(); " under the line that says " MooseInit init(argc,argv) " 
  

That it. Now go make and rebuild the MOOSE application. After that, you can use the ss-lite solver in your
MOOSE application just as you would any other Petsc solver. ( i.e., through the input file or through the command line ) 


See Makefile.example and main.example for an example of the modifications required.
