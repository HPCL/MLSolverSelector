This directory is used to manage the feature sets that are available in the SS-Lite 
library when it is compiled. 

Basically, the library supports a large number of features. However, it is propably
the case that you do not need all of them, so this allows us to pick only the 
features that are actually used in the model

For performance reasons (way to many if statements), we implemented the Feature
sets using MACROs. This means feature sets must be known in advance. 


Adding a feature set is simple. 

 1) Copy the fullfeatureset.fs file from the templates directory to the impls directory 
    and give it a unique name. Do not change the filename extension  -- i.e it must be <>.fs

 2) Open the new <unique>.fs file. In there is a list of #defines, the names of which are features
    available in the code. Define any features you do not want to be zero -- i.e., 
       
      #define FEATURE _FEATURE -----> #define FEATURE 0 // _FEATURE
  
  3) Save the file. 

  4) cd to feature_sets/ and run the ./generateExtraction.sh script. This will autogenerate the 
     required C++ files and make the Feature set available in the library

  5) cd .. back to the main directory and recompile the library
       make clean && make && make install

  6) Remake any examples, then when running you can pass the parameter -ksp_ss_featureset <your-unique-name-from-step-1>
