This directory is used to manage the feature sets that are available in the SS-Lite 
library when it is compiled. 

Basically, the library supports a large number of features. However, it is propably
the case that you do not need all of them, so this allows us to pick only the 
features that are actually used in the model

For performance reasons (way to many if statements), we implemented the Feature
sets using MACROs. This means feature sets must be precompiled as part of the library. 

Adding a feature set is simple. 

 1) Copy the featureSet.template file from the templates directory to the impls directory 
    and give it a unique name. 

        cp templates/featureSet.template impls <unique-name>.fs 

 2) Open the new impls/<unique-name>.fs file. In there is a list of #defines, the names of which are features
    available in the code. Define any features you do not want to be zero (see example.fs). ( If you remove a 
    feature rather than defining its value to zero, the library will not compile )  
 
 3) Go back to the main directory and do ---  make clean && make && make install 

 4) To use the feature set in petsc use the command line option  -ksp_ss_featureset <your-unique-name-from-step-1>
