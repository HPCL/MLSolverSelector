Running should be as simple as :

export PETSC_DIR=path/to/petsc/dir
python petsc_options_list.py


This should produce two files: 
    1. PetscPreconOptions.db -- A text file containing all the preconditioners available in petsc with the options
    2. PetscSolverOptions.db -- Same, but for the krylov solvers.
