Utilities directory for using petsc with the solver selecter. MM2Petsc will
convert a matrix market matrix to petsc binary form. This is a slightly 
modified version of one of the petsc examples. The python script petsc_options_scan
scans petsc and pulls out all the solver options. These are then written to the 
files PetscSolversOptions and PetscPrecondOptions. These can then be used to 
populate an input list for building a database.
