 Feature extraction for Petsc Matricies

Hi,

1. Installation: 
     a) export PETSC_DIR =<path-to-petsc>
     b) make

2. Running a single example
     a)./matrix_free.a 
           (i) Simulates feature extraction for Bratu, prints features to stdout
           (ii) Edit the size of the "matrix" in the petsc_feature_extract_mf.C file
     b)./matrix_binary.a <path_to_petsc_binary_matrix> <output_file>
           (i) loads petsc matrix and extracts features using matrix-free methods. 
           (ii) should work fine in parallel but the results will differ with processor 
                counts ( i still need to figure out petscs internal dof numbering system ) 
           (iii) prints data to file outputfile

3. Running multiple matricies
    a) Open up ./batch_extract.sh and set the matrix_directory and matrix extension and output_file
    b) chmod u+x ./batch_extract.sh 
    c) Running ./batch_extract will run feature extract on all matrices in that directory with the given
       extension.
