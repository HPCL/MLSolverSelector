This is all the data extracted using Petsc. 

- The matrices are all from the florida sparse matrix collection. 
- The matrices used where from a list I found on the repo. 
- All times are in microseconds. 

FILES:

exact_mat_features.csv. I downloaded this from the repository. The matrices used in these tests are the same as those listed in this file. 
- features_all_interior: This file holds the exact features as calculated by the petsc_extraction code. There are a few features where we get slightly different values. 

- features_all_interior_timing: This file gives the time to load the matrix, setup the ksp and extract the features on my system. 

- solver_timing : This file can be ignored.

- solver_timing_timing : Gives the solve times for each matrix with GMRES/Jacobi ( the header says ILU, but that is incorrect). I chose GMRES with Jacboi because it is robust (i.e., works for pretty much anything); however, Jacobi is pretty slow, and not used in practice very often. 

 full/features_X_Y : contains features for sample set with 10 edge points and Y interior points.
 full/features_x_y_timing gives the extraction timing 

RS1/features_X_Y : same for Reduced feature set 1 
RS2/features_X_Y : same for Reduced feature set 2


Figures/*.jpg are all the figures generated from this data. These are auto-generated using the python script in the previous directory, so, if you need to change the figures, let me know, and I can explain that script.
