\section{Participants and Collaborators}
%IV.	PARTICIPANTS & OTHER COLLABORATING ORGANIZATIONS:} Mandatory
%Who has been involved?
%Agencies need to know who has worked on the project to gauge and report performance in promoting partnerships and collaborations. The following information on participants must be provided:} 

\subsection{Participants}
%1.	Participants
%What individuals have worked on the project?
%Provide the following information for:} (1) principal investigator(s)/project director(s) (PIs/PDs); and (2) each person who has worked at least one person month per year on the project during the reporting period, regardless of the source of compensation (a person month equals approximately 160 hours of effort).
%Provide the name and identify the role the person played in the project. Do NOT include any other identifying information on individuals. Indicate the nearest whole person month (Calendar, Academic, Summer) that the individual worked on the project. Show the most senior role in which the person has worked on the project for any significant length of time. For example, if an undergraduate student graduates, enters graduate school, and continues to work on the project, show that person as a graduate student, preferably explaining the change in involvement. Describe how this person contributed to the project and with what funding support. If information is unchanged from a previous submission, provide the name only and indicate ?no change?. Identify whether this person is collaborating internationally. Specifically is the person collaborating with an individual located in a foreign country and whether the person had traveled to the foreign country as part of that collaboration and duration of stay. The foreign country(ies) should be identified.

%3.	Other Collaborators
%Have other collaborators or contacts been involved? 
%Some significant collaborators or contacts within the recipient?s organization may not be covered by ?What people have worked on the project??
