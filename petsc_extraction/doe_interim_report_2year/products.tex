\section{Products}
%III.	PRODUCTS: Optional (Mandatory if Products Exist)
%What has the project produced? 
%Publications are the characteristic product of research. Agencies evaluate what the publications demonstrate about the excellence and significance of the research and the efficacy with which the results are being communicated to colleagues, potential users, and the public, not the number of publications. Many projects (though not all) develop significant products other than publications. Agencies assess and report both publications and other products to Congress, communities of interest, and the public.
%List any products resulting from the project during the reporting period. Examples of products include: publications, conference papers, and presentations; website(s) or other Internet site(s); technologies or techniques; inventions, patent applications, and/or licenses; and other products, such as data or databases, physical collections, audio or video products, software or NetWare, models, educational aids or curricula, instruments, or equipment, or any other public release of information related to the project.

\subsection{Publications}
None this period; however, a paper based on the matrix-free feature extraction techniques is currently being written.

%y the major publication(s) resulting from the work under this award. There is no restriction on the number. However, agencies are interested in only those publications that most reflect the work under this award in the following categories: 
%i.	Journal publications. List peer-reviewed articles or papers appearing in scientific, technical, or professional journals. Include any peer-reviewed publication in the periodically published proceedings of a scientific society, a conference, or the like. A publication in the proceedings of a one-time conference, not part of a series, should be reported under ?Books or other non-periodical, one-time publications.? Identify for each publication: Author(s); title; journal; volume: year; page numbers; status of publication (published; accepted, awaiting publication; submitted, under review; other); acknowledgement of federal support (yes/no).

%iv.	Website(s) or other Internet site(s).  List the URL for any Internet site(s) that disseminates the results of the research activities. A short description of each site should be provided. It is not necessary to include the publications already specified above in this section.

\subsection{Intellectual Property}
None this period.
%2.	Intellectual Property
%Identify inventions, patent applications with date, and/or licenses that have resulted from the research. Submission of this information as part of an interim research performance progress report is not a substitute for any other invention reporting required under the terms and conditions of an award.

\subsection{Technologies and Techniques}
None this period.
%3.	Technologies or Techniques
%Identify technologies or techniques that have resulted from the research activities. Describe the technologies or techniques and how they are being shared.

%\subsection{Other Products}
%4.	Other Products
%Identify any other significant products that were developed under this project. Describe the product and how it is being shared. Examples of other products are: Databases; Physical collections; Audio or video products; Software or NetWare; Models; Educational aids or curricula; Instruments or equipment; Data & Research Material (e.g., cell lines, DNA probes, animal models); and Other.
